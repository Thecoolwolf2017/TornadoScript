# Sound Files Required

Place the following sound files in this directory:

1. `tornado-weather-alert.wav` - Tornado warning siren sound
2. `rumble-bass-2.wav` - Tornado low rumble ambient sound

## Installation

1. Create these sound files or obtain them from a sound effects library
2. Place them directly in this directory
3. They will be automatically copied to the user's GTA V directory when needed

## File Requirements

- Format: WAV files
- Names must match exactly as shown above
- Files should be high quality but reasonably sized
- Recommended to use 44.1kHz, 16-bit WAV format

## Locations Checked

The mod will look for sound files in these locations in order:

1. Development directory (this folder)
2. User's GTA V directory: `Documents/GTA V/scripts/TornadoScript/sounds/`

If sounds are not found, the mod will continue to run with sound features disabled.
